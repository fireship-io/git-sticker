THen i created a file in the forked github 
Then i tried to create a pull request
I went to Contributers and cliked on open pull request // I have no idea whether is it correct//

Git commands

git push
git difftool

go to the git bash and type git clone and the htts of the github repository
then go to the file by typing cd filr name
open the file in the vscode or pycharm
run git status
then add the files in the repo using git add
then commit the changes: git commit -m'first commiy'
and finally use git push to push the repository
